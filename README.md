## ✅ Steps Followed

1. **Download and Clean the Dataset**
   - Removed missing values and standardized column names.
   - Ensured consistent data types for analysis.
   - Cleaned using Python (Pandas) and exported to a clean CSV.

2. **Load Data into MySQL**
   - Created a MySQL database and table to store cleaned data.
   - Used SQL to run queries and perform data aggregation.

3. **SQL Analysis**
   - Aggregated CO₂ emissions by country and sector.
   - Identified top-emitting countries over different years.
   - Used queries to group, sort, and filter data effectively.

4. **Power BI Visualizations**
   - Developed interactive dashboards.
   - Key visuals:
     - Top 10 CO₂ emitting countries.
     - Emission trend over years.
     - Emissions by sector (Agriculture, Energy, etc.).
     - Comparative analysis between countries.

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Countries like **USA, China, and India** are among the top CO₂ emitters.
- The **Agriculture and Energy sectors** are the most significant contributors.
- Emissions show a rising trend in developing nations over time.
